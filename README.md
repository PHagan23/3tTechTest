Instructions for setting up:

Install Node JS


    Upload the project from your office pc to a git repo (or personal GitHub if you dont have any company repo).

    Clone the repo to your local pc.

    Run npm install to install all dependencies found in you package/ package-lock files.
    (Ps: this only requires from you to have Node and Npm installed to your PC. Every other dependency (f.e cypress, chai, etc) would install on THE SAME VERSION as the master repo
