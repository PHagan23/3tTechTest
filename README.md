# Encountered Issues

## Cypress would not load on initial set up

Root Cause: NodeJS version was too old - Incompatible

Used a Linux partition that had existed for a couple of years but no updates had been done - NodeJS was very far behind in versionion and was incompatible with the freshly installed Cypress
This should not be an issue on a fresh install

Solution: Update NodeJS

## Amazon thinks I'm a robot

Root Cause: Continuous Test Runs

Due to running automation several times, Amazon thinks i'm a robot and requires a captcha which causes the test suite to fail

Solution: Overthrow Amazon in a coup d'Ã©tat

## Cy.visit(https://amazon.co.uk) directs to a different version of the Amazon site which the automation does not work on

Root Cause: Unknown

Solution: Introduce if statement in the 'BeforeEach' hook that checks if the suite has been directed to the required / correct version of the amazon site by identifying an element that is only present on the required version as a condition to proceed. If this element is not identified, run Cy.visit(https://amazon.co.uk) again to attempt to direct to required version of the site
